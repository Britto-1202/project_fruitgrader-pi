# Smart Fruit Grading System using Raspberry Pi

Identifying freshness of a fruit plays an important role in the food industry as it ensures that the fruit is safe for consumption. In this project, a standalone system that detects the freshness of fruits based on visual perception has been developed using Raspberry Pi. This system uses a camera to capture images of the fruit and machine learning algorithm to determine whether the fruit is fresh or rotten. Fresh and rotten fruit images were used to train the algorithm, and a set of test images was used to test the accuracy of the model. This system enables us to distinguish fresh fruit from rotten fruit, can be used in many places such as supermarkets, greengrocers and agricultural area. Thus, allows only fresh fruit to be sold and eaten and has the potential to improve the food industryâ€™s quality control process and reduce food waste.
